#CS 115 bash script grading test

#Runs test script against all files in a folder, saving output to Output.txt

#Runs the test script for all files in the specified folder, 
#modifying the test script file to import the current file
#then runs the test script for that file, saving the output to Output.txt in the same folder as the test script
#Output.txt has the output from the test script each file as well as the names of each file. They are numbered as well.
#For some test scripts, change the import so that only one thing needs to be changed.
#What I did was take all of my students submissions and put them in their own folder
#I usually ran this in the top level directory. For me, that was /mnt/c/Users/Daniel/Documents/College Work/Semester 5/CS 115 CA/
    # (This was on WSL2)
#I had to have the /bin/ stuff to get it to work for me. You may need to change that.
